            "Coin" is a cryptocurrency token inspired by the hit TV series "Stranger Things." It leverages
            the show's fandom to create a digital asset with a humorous and community-driven ethos. However, investors
            should exercise caution due to its speculative nature and potential volatility.

                <p>"Taxes 0/0" typically refers to a tax rate of zero percent on transactions within a cryptocurrency
                    ecosystem. This means that no taxes or fees are imposed on transactions, resulting in a tax-free
                    environment for users. This approach is often employed to promote adoption and encourage
                    transactions within the ecosystem by eliminating the financial burden associated with taxes.</p>

                    "Supply: 1 million" indicates that the total supply of a cryptocurrency token is one million units.
                    This fixed quantity of tokens is available within the ecosystem and may be distributed among users
                    through various mechanisms such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), airdrops, mining, or other means.
                    The limited supply often contributes to the token's scarcity, potentially impacting its value and
                    demand dynamics within the market.</p>

                <p>"Liquidity burned" is the process of permanently removing tokens from circulation in a cryptocurrency
                    ecosystem. This is typically done to decrease the total token supply, increase scarcity, and
                    potentially boost the value of the remaining tokens. It's a common practice in DeFi projects to
                    manage token economics and encourage value appreciation.</p>

                    "Mint & Freeze Revoked" means the cancellation of the ability to create new tokens or restrict token
                    transferability within a cryptocurrency ecosystem. This action is taken to prevent further token
                    creation or restrictions on token movements, often to maintain transparency or decentralization.
